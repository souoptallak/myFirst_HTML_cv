<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm a junior web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, simple, and user-friendly websites. I'm currently focusing on mastering the fundamentals of web development, starting with HTML and gradually expanding my skills to CSS and JavaScript. Building websites from scratch is something I really enjoy—it’s exciting to see my ideas come to life in the browser.</p>

<p>I started learning web development because I love technology and the creativity it allows. Through personal projects and hands-on practice, I’ve learned how structure, accessibility, and layout play a key role in great websites. Every project I work on helps me improve and get one step closer to becoming a professional full-stack developer.

</p>

<p>Right now, my goal is to continue learning and building real-world projects that help people. I'm currently exploring design principles, responsive layouts, and soon, interactivity with JavaScript. I’m always excited to take on new challenges, collaborate with others, and grow as a developer—one line of code at a time.</p>
